Node - javascript runtime. Node is used to execute javascript code outside the browser in some arbitrary environment
Express - Library that runs in the Node runtime. Has helpers to make dealing with HTTP traffic easier. Express is not standalone. 
          Its a library within Node to handle HTTP traffic. It's just a helper, and everything in Express can be written from scratch from Node.

          HTTP Request -> Node -> Express. Express looks at the request and then decides
          which chunk of code will handle or respond to the request, and chooses the appropriate route handler.
          Express has several route handlers which generate a response.
          Response -> Node. Node processes the response and sends it back to whoever made the HTTP request

          
After running heroku create,
we get back 2 URLs.
https://pacific-sea-06207.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/pacific-sea-06207.git

First is link to heroku app, second is link our deployment target. It is remote.
We push to this remote git repo for the app. When we push to that git repo, it deploys our application and starts it up automatically

If running the command tells you that 'remote heroku already exists' that is fine. No output at all also fine

git push heroku master
git push [remote] [local]

'heroku open' will open our application
'heroku log' will give you logs about the heroku app in case something went wrong
